# Contributing to matlab2tikz

You can contribute in many ways to `matlab2tikz`:
 - report bugs and suggest new features,
 - fix some of our bugs and implement new features.

## How to report a bug or ask for help

 1. Make sure you are using the [latest release]() or even the [development version]() of `matlab2tikz` and check that the problem still exists.
 2. Also make sure you are using a recent version of the required LaTeX packages (especially `pgfplots` and the `TikZ` libraries)
 3. You can submit your bug report or question to our [issue tracker]().
    Have a look at "[How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)" and "[Writing Better Bug Reports](http://martiancraft.com/blog/2014/07/good-bug-reports/)" for generic guidelines.Please make sure you include the following things:
    - The version of MATLAB/Octave, the operating system, `matlab2tikz`, `pgfplots` and which `LaTeX` compiler you are using.
    - Choose a descriptive title.
    - A short MATLAB code snippet that generates a plot where the problem occurs. Please limit this to what is strictly necessary to show the issue!
    - Explain what is wrong with how the figure is converted (or what error messages you get).
    - Often it can be useful to also include a figure, `TikZ` code, ... to illustrate your point.


## How to request new features

Please check first whether the feature hasn't been [requested](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz/labels/feature%20request) before and do join the relevant topic in that case or maybe it has already been implemented in the [latest development version]().

If your feature is something new and graphical, please also have a look at the [`pgfplots`]() manual to see whether what you want is supported by this package.
It might be more constructive to (also?) request the feature for `pgfplots` in [their bug tracker]().

Please submit you feature request as any [bug report]() and make sure that you include enough details in your post, e.g.:
 - What should it look like or how should it work?
 - Is there a relevant section in the `pgfplots` or `MATLAB` documentation?
