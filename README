This is matlab2tikz, a MATLAB script for converting MATLAB figures into native
TikZ figures. matlab2tikz is based on Paul Wagenaars' matfig2pgf but tries to
be shorter, cleaner, more robust and more powerful.

As of now, matlab2tikz does by far not support the conversion of all possible
MATLAB figures. In particular, 3D plots are not yet supported. However, the if
you have a nice 2D plot, matlab2tikz might just do what you want it to.

The plots that matlab2tikz handles properly are, but are not limited to

  * most axes properties (including logarithmic scaling),
  * grids,
  * line plots (including markers line styles),
  * contour(f) plots,
  * bar plots (stacked, grouped, histgrams),
  * stem plots,
  * stairs plots,
  * quiver (arrow) plots,
  * colorbars,
  * legends,
  * (images),
  * (rose plots),
  * (compass plots),
  * (polar plots).


The workflow is as follows.

  0.) a) Place the matlab2tikz script in a directory where MATLAB can find it
         (the current directory, for example).
      b) Make sure that your LaTeX installation includes the packages

            tikz

	 and

	    pgfplots.

  1.) Generate your plot in MATLAB.

  2.) Invoke matlab2tikz by

        >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz' );

  3.) Add the contents of myfile.tikz into your LaTeX source code; a
      convenient way of doing so is to use \input{/path/to/myfile.tikz}.
      Also make sure that at the header of your document the packages tikz and
      pgfplots are included:

          \usepackage{tikz}
          \usepackage{pgfplots}
