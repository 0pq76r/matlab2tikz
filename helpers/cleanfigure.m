function cleanfigure()
%   CLEANFIGURE() removes the unnecessary objects from your MATLAB plot
%   to give you a better experience with matlab2tikz.

%   CLEANFIGURE comes with several options that can be combined at will.
%
%   CLEANFIGURE('handle',HANDLE,...) explicitly specifies the
%   handle of the figure that is to be stored. (default: gcf)
%
%   Example
%      x = -pi:pi/1000:pi;
%      y = tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x));
%      plot(x,y,'--rs');
%      coarsenLine2d(0.1);
